                            <p>The Internet and AI have revolutionized the globalized society and enabled the growth of
                                infrastructures, applications, and technologies that significantly enhance global
                                interactions and collaborations that have a significant impact on society. Unprecedented

                                and the growing number of collaboration-enabling technologies such as generative AI,
                                large language models (LLMs), machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning,
                                federated learning, and multimodal learning. Individuals and organizations have
                                increasingly relied on electronic and/or Internet-enabled collaboration between
                                distributed teams of humans, computer applications, and/or autonomous robots to achieve
                                higher productivity and produce collaboratively developed products that would have been
                                impossible to develop without the contributions of multiple collaborators.

                                advancements in networking, technology and systems, user interfaces and interaction,

                                IEEE Policy and professional ethics require that referees treat the contents of papers

                                Organizers of IEEE conferences are expected to provide an appropriate forum for the oral
                                presentation and discussion of all accepted papers. An author, in offering a paper for
                                presentation at an IEEE conference, or accepting an invitation to present a paper, is
                                expected to be present at the meeting to deliver the paper. In the event that
                                circumstances
                                unknown at the time of submission of a paper preclude its presentation by an author, the
                                program chair should be informed on time, and appropriate substitute arrangements should
                                be
                                made. In some cases it may help reduce no-shows for the Conference to require advance
                                registration together with the submission of the final manuscript.
