                                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming our business, social and physical
                                world. Machine Intelligence and computing artifacts
                                infused with AI and cognition are increasingly becoming an integral part of our social
                                and economic activities/processes, as well as cultural
                                and business interactions. The cognitive machine intelligence (CogMI) is creating
                                unprecedented opportunities for impactful scientific
                                innovations and societal transformations by significantly augmenting the human ability
                                for problem solving and rapid decision making in terms of speed,
                                precision and variety, while fostering innovations in all our human endeavors from
                                scientific discoveries, solving long standing healthcare problems, '
                                modeling highly interconnected and globally distributed systems, and so forth. As we
                                enter the new social, physical and cyber world empowered by such
                                cognitive machine intelligence, it is important to understand and explore the
                                foundational characteristics of the algorithmic theory and processes
                                behind the cognitive machine intelligence, and now intelligent machines can promote a
                                productive and creative partnership and collaboration between
                                the humans and the machines, so as to ensure an equitable, fair and transparent
                                CogMI-enhanced society and cyber-physical-social worlds around us.

                                The goal of the IEEE Conference on Cognitive Machine Intelligence (IEEE CogMI) is to
                                create a research and development forum on cognitive machine intelligence
                                to foster research results on AI and ML with cognitive science and behavioral science.
                                It promotes productive collaborations among experts from multiple disciplines,
                                such as but not limited to: computer science, electronic and computer engineering,
                                information science, economics, industrial engineering, psychology, social and
                                behavioral sciences, biological and physical sciences, and ethics, law and policy. IEEE
                                CogMI aims to be a premier, highly multidisciplinary forum to foster interaction
                                and exchange of innovative ideas, and collaboration among researchers, practitioners,
                                philosophers from academia, industry and government sectors who are interested in
                                developing innovative AI/ML algorithms, applications and systems by integrating
                                cognitive science and understanding how AI can support humans instead of replacing them,
                                resulting in productive and desirable social-technical systems

                                IEEE Policy and professional ethics require that referees treat the contents of papers

                                expected that no one with access to a paper under review will make any inappropriate use
                                of
                                the special knowledge, which that access provides. Contents of abstracts submitted to
                                conference program committees should be regarded as privileged as well, and handled in
                                the
                                same manner. The Conference Publications Chair shall ensure that referees adhere to this

                                Organizers of IEEE conferences are expected to provide an appropriate forum for the oral
                                presentation and discussion of all accepted papers. An author, in offering a paper for
                                presentation at an IEEE conference, or accepting an invitation to present a paper, is
                                expected to be present at the meeting to deliver the paper. In the event that
                                circumstances
                                unknown at the time of submission of a paper preclude its presentation by an author, the
                                program chair should be informed on time, and appropriate substitute arrangements should
                                be
                                made. In some cases it may help reduce no-shows for the Conference to require advance
                                registration together with the submission of the final manuscript.
